####Why:
The goal is to get students in practice using Git & Github, and to get them comfortable with one-off interview questions. This format also allows for super simple attendance tracking to keep the tracking process off the shoulders of the instructors.

####What:
This repo contains morning warmups for web dev students to complete in the mornings before lecture. Typically the time given for completion ranges from 45 to 60 minutes. 

These warmups also export an attendance word for easy tracking of attendance using [Tyler's GitHub Autograder] (https://github.com/gSchool/github-autograder)




####How:
* ```npm install mocha -g``` to install mocha globally (if not done already)
* ```npm install``` to install the chai node module
* Each student works along following the prompt's instructions
* They can run tests if they want by running ```mocha test/m-test.js``` from the root repo directory
* These problems are ready to use with the autograder
