User-Validation Warmup
===
Hello, I am the product owner at your company and I need you to start on the following stories for me... Please make sure all of your code is tested.
I need these done in 30 minutes, too!

1. Create a new rails app called store-warmup

2. A user can register for the site from the homepage
  - a user must have a valid name
  - a user must have a valid and unique email address
  - a user must have a valid phone number
  - a user can have a valid address (address line, city, state, and zip code)
