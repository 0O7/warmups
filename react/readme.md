# React Warmups

## Setup

Clone locally and run `npm install`

Then to start, run `npm start`

Files will be watched and built continuously until you quit the command

## Concepts

- Compiling with Webpack & Babel
- JSX
- Props vs State
- Lists
- Conditionals

## Tasks to Complete
Warmup Day 1:
- Allow toggling the state of a card to be `completed` (style how you'd like)

Warmup Day 2:
- Make the form submission update the list of To Do's

Warmup Day 3:
- Upon form submission make a query to HackerNews to fetch stories related to the title of the todo text.
  After the results from HackerNews is returned, log the results to the console, then update the list of To Do's.
  This is what a query to HackerNews looks like: https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=searchTerm

Warmup Day 4:
  - Allow creating a new To Do list with custom title
