// Paths in the Grid

// You have a grid with m rows and n columns.
// Return number of ways that you can start from point A to reach point B.
// you are only allowed to move right and up.

// In the picture grid-picture.png (take a look), there are 10 pathes from A to B.

// Hint: Use mathematical permutation and combination

// if you have time, write some more tests!
