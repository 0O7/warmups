# Domain Modeling

You're helping build the next big real estate application. You and your team are all set to disrupt the market
if you can successfully model your domain and release your software.

You are handed several user stories. Before you get started, you decide to sit down and model out the domain to support
such crazy requirements.

As you go through each story, build up the model that you think will satisfy the story. Each addition must not "break"
 previous requirements. Given the pace of the start-up world, you only have 20 minutes to accomplish your task.
